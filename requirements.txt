1. Notes App
Create a web app in which users can add and store their notes. This is an excellent project for beginners. Some pointers to keep in mind while building a notes app are:

- The user should be able to create, edit and delete a note.
 
- When the user closes the browser window, the notes should be stored, and when the user returns, the data should be retrieved back.
 
- Users should be able to see the date and time of the creation of the note.
 
- After you have made a basic app, try adding the following features to take it up to the next level-
 
- The app should be able to take multiple entries per note, with the new entry having the current date and time.
 
- Users should be able to search for a note based on a keyword.
 
- Users should be able to sort and filter using date and time information.
 
- To make the project even more challenging, display a calendar layout so that the user can click on any date to view the notes of that particular day.
